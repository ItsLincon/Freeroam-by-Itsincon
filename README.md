# Freeroam-by-Itsincon

Greetings Github users!

Today I come to give you a freeroam for the FiveM platform already made, without the need for programs other than artifacts, that consume part of your machine or your pc, whether it be XAMPP, MariaDB, Mysql-server, etc.

The only requirement that I ask of you is that every so often, for the sake of your server, the security of your data / users and future gaps that fivem programmers may patch, you update the artifacts to their latest, most stable version.

LINUX https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/

WINDOWS https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/

All the scripts are free to use but not open edition, that is, those scripts that are not public in the fivem forum or, failing that, in github, will be encrypted so that they cannot be edited by other users for commercial purposes.
